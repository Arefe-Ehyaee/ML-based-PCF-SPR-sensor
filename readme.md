# ANN Model for Predicting Sensor Parameters**
   - We've implemented a novel Artificial Neural Network (ANN) model to accurately predict confinement loss and amplitude sensitivity of the suggested SPR-based PCF sensor.
   - By leveraging machine learning, our model achieves high precision, eliminating the need for the imaginary part of the effective refractive index.

2. **Three Different Scenarios Investigation**
   - Our research encompasses three distinct scenarios, providing a comprehensive understanding of the PCF sensor's behavior under varied conditions.
   - Explore the ANN models' adaptability and robustness across different scenarios, contributing to the versatility of our findings.

3. **Dataset File from COMSOL Multiphysics**
   - The repository includes a crucial CSV dataset file (`data.csv`) generated through COMSOL Multiphysics software.
   - This dataset serves as the foundation for training and validating the ANN models, facilitating transparency and reproducibility in our research.
