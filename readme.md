# ANN Model for Predicting Sensor Parameters
   - We've implemented a novel Artificial Neural Network (ANN) model to accurately predict confinement loss and amplitude sensitivity of the suggested SPR-based PCF sensor.
   - By leveraging machine learning, our model achieves high precision, eliminating the need for the imaginary part of the effective refractive index.

   - Our research encompasses three distinct scenarios, providing a comprehensive understanding of the PCF sensor's behavior under varied conditions.
     
   - The repository includes a crucial dataset file (`Collected_Data.csv`) generated through COMSOL Multiphysics software. It serves as the foundation for training and validating the ANN models in our research.
